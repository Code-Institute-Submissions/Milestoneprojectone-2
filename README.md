## Testing

When testing i have been working with validator.w3.org for the HTML and for the CSS jogsaw.w3.org validator.

When testing the first time i got a few errors regarding the icon links. And the links to each site. I first started doint the project in visual studios but later on changed to gitpod and then i hadent made a few changes to connect each website. And i also got a warning regardning one section that lacked a h element. And that has been changed so the warning isent showing.

Testing later i got a few errors about the social links and icons that the end tag of was missing. The problem was then fixed and the error did not show again. Also one paragraph text missed the end tag and the problem was fixed.

A lot of missing end tags at each time for testing. All has been fixed.

When validating the Style css i got no errors.

Been having problems with the commit to github. I started working in Visual studio code for the project and did almost everything in visual studios and when i tried to commit to github it dident work. 
i insalled git and tried several times but it dident commit. So after a while i decided to try to get copy my code and putt it to gitpod so i could start commiting my code. 

I did also have trubble to commit everything i noticed that when i did changes and then commitet every new code dident fallow.
